Branding is the oxygen of the business. You may have the best quality product at a reasonable rate or offer the best services in the market. But as long as people don’t recognize your business name, they won’t buy your products or avail services from you.
This is where branding comes in. It is like making people aware that you are there in the market. Branding is like a trust builder and is directly proportional to the success of your business. The stronger your branding game is, the higher you can climb the ladder of success.
Now the question in hand Is- How to do Branding? What should be your branding strategy?  Let’s find out? 
1.       On the point user experience- Branding starts with the moment a user visits your website. It is like the first impression and certainly, it is always about the first impression!  Having a responsive site is a must. The website should be
•         Mobile Friendly –As majority of people use mobile for surfing, make sure your website is mobile-friendly or you may lose out on your potential customers.
•         High speed- No one likes a slow website. A user will simply close the tab and probably never visit your website again.
•         Organized- People should be able to navigate your website easily. Everything should be well organized for a better user experience.
 
2.       Visibility on the search engine- Almost all the users that visit your website come organically. So it’s very important that users are able to find you on Google search results. This is where SEO comes handy. SEO is the method of bringing your website at the top of search results organically. It means if a user searches something he wants to buy on search query, your website comes at the top of his search result.
Give importance to both On-Page and Off-Page SEO. Take professional help, don’t focus on doing it on your own as doing it the wrong way can have a negative impact on your website. 
 
3.       Be found on Social Media- Only being present on Google is not enough, your business  should be everywhere, on all the relevant social media platforms. Literally everyone is on social media these days, so make the most out of it. Pipe in the right strategy, target the right people on the relevant platform, get a Brand Management company to do this!
For eg- If your business caters to the needs of old age people like multivitamins for the elderly, your target audience should be old people or at least, children who have aged parents. Also, the engagement should be more on Facebook than Instagram as on Instagram the target base is usually of very young people.
4.       Brand Awareness and credibility - Having a website and being available on social media is important to create brand awareness but having people trust your business becomes a whole different level. This is where Public Relation Services comes in. Not many people understand its importance or how it works. But PR works in providing the right information to the right people via right medium.
Getting your business mentioned in a reputed newspaper will definitely increase your business credibility and make people trust you along with people getting aware of the business. Another benefit of having a PR is that it also does damage control and is a lifesaver in case of crises! A company may face backlash or criticism from its customers from time to time, having a PR makes sure that the damage done at this time is minimal. 
 
5.       Engagement game to be on the point- Branding is all about how much people are engaged in your business. Having a huge fan base on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter means nothing if people are not engaging with your posts, messages. Engage with your customers, ask them their feedback, make creative posts, give them discounts and be prompt when someone has a query.
Having done all this is very important because it makes the customers realize how much you value them and they will come to you for your services time and again. Social Media Management is all about this.
 
6.       Multi-Channel Marketing- The marketing should be multi-channel. You should tap each and every marketing platform. A marketing channel that may work for one customer may not work for the other. Along with the normal platforms like FB, Instagram, etc., a business should also tap on channels like
 
•         Email Marketing- Curate an email list of all your customers and send them the emails telling them about new arrivals or products, new coupons, new features now and then.
•         LinkedIn- LinkedIn is where all the professionals are. If your business is B2B, this is a must-have platform for you as all the people working in businesses are there, busy networking. One must make the most out of it.
•         YouTube- Some things are better shown than told and if it is in video form it takes it to the next level. Make videos of the products and services you offer. Post them on YouTube, share them on different platforms.
 
 
7.       Take leverage of Advertising- Along with all the organic methods, it's helpful if we take full leverage of the paid promotions. It will only fasten up the speed of our branding strategy.
       Run paid ads on Facebook, display your products on another relevant website with the help of Google Ads, showcase your best features, and visually engage with the users. The goal is when someone sees your banner or post anywhere, they should instantly recognize you!
Building a brand was never easy and never will be. This being said. Apart for making a good branding strategy, its execution is equally important. A lot businesses don’t do well because they make a branding strategy but seldom execute it religiously. It takes constant checks, making changes whenever required and execute it efficiently. It certainly takes time but in the end it is always worth it! Who does not want a brand which is successful anyways?
